## BC Ministry of Health PharmaNet Electronic Prescribing API

This repository holds the architecture and components to enable PharmaNet electronic prescribing in British Columbia.

## Objectives

This project has three primary objectives:

1. Migrate off HN-Secure private network, removing the need for proprietary HN-Client software packages to be deployed by clients.
2. Add Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Capabilities using  HTTPS transport and modern OAuth2 authentication and authorization standards.
3. Longer-term, add support for HL7 FHIR editions of the HL7-v2 PharmaNet Interactions.

## About PharmaNet

Every prescription dispensed in community pharmacies in B.C. is entered into PharmaNet.

PharmaNet, administered by the Ministry of Health, was developed in consultation with health professionals and the public to improve prescription safety and support prescription claim processing.

PharmaNet users include community pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, emergency departments, hospitals, community health practices, the College of Pharmacists of British Columbia. and the College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia.
